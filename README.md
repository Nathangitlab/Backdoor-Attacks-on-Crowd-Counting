# Backdoor-Attacks-Crowd-Counting
**Paper Link**

##
This work is supported by Hubei Engineering Research Center on Big Data Security. We greatly thank our supervisors Professor Pan Zhou and Professor Xinjun Ma for providing us with valuable guidance in every stage of the writing of this thesis. From our views, the most difficult part of backdooring these crowd counting models is how to control the connection of predicted density maps and the orginal input images and their ground truth values (high-dimemtional location values).

* This is the official implementation code of paper submitted to ACM MM 2022.
* We are the first work to backdoor density-based crowd counting models.
