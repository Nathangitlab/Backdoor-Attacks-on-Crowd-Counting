# backdoor-attack-counter-model
this is for the ACM MM paper---Backdoor Attack on Crowd Counting
It may be the first time that backdoor attacks are implemented in the crowd counting models (one of regression models). For explaining all findings we have got, experiments are finished in 5 classical Counter Models with 4 different datasets.
We release the test part of the code to show the authenticity of the experiment.
